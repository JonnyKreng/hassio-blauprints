  name: Update Sonoff TRV Valve 
  description: >
    Adjusts the valve closing/opening degrees based on a PID controller output,
    the buildings efficiency and indoor and outdoor temepature readings. Using 
    sonoff trvs and https://github.com/bvweerd/simple_pid_controller together 
    with his automation should result in a really efficent heating solution.
